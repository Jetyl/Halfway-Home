		It was that same dream again, but this time I knew I was dreaming. That's never happened before.
		The events of the week prior feel so far away... lost to the vivid horror of the nightmare. I can barely remember any of it.
		I guess I've got to get ready to leave now, but I'm not really in a rush.
		I lay staring at the ceiling, as I've done so many times before, wondering what the next roof over my head will look like.

		Must be Max, to take me away from this limbo.

===Introductions===
[Keyless>Max] "Hella yella, my {player_name} fella." # Keyless = Calm
What?
[{player_name}] "Huh?"
"Ugh... @Morning, Max."
[Keyless>Max] "Morning? It's almost noon! Don't tell me I was your alarm clock this morning!"
[{player_name}] "N-no... @I was already awake."
[Keyless>Max] "That's good. Pretty soon ya won't have the ol' Max alarm to rely on."
[{player_name}] "Yeah."
[Timothy>Scrawny looking kid] "..." # Timothy = Calm #Timothy = stage_Right
[{player_name}] "Who's that?"
[Keyless>Max] "This is Timothy Miyuri. He's the new resident I told you about, remember?"
[{player_name}] "Uh... yeah."
[Keyless>Max] "You don't remember, do you?"
[{player_name}] "... @No."
Max looks disappointed in me. It's a sadly common look. # Keyless = Sad
[Keyless>Max] "Look, I know you'd really prefer not having a roommate, but we're tight on space right now."
"Besides, it'll only be for one week."
[Timothy] "Nice to meet you." # Timothy = Happy
[Keyless>Max] "Anyways, Timothy, this is {player_name}, pronouns are {pronouns}. You'll be sharing this room with {possesive} for the next week." # Keyless = Calm
[Timothy] "Okay." # Timothy = Calm
Timothy and Max both invite themselves into my room carrying several bags, likely full of Timothy's belongings.
Once Max has got all the bags in, they pat themselves down in a brief panic, before realizing something is wrong. // Could remove line
[Keyless>Max] "Oh crap." # Keyless = Surprised
[{player_name}] "What?"
[Keyless>Max] "I can't find my keys! I must have left 'em somewhere..."
[{player_name}] "Uh-oh." // Could remove line
[Keyless>Max] "Yeah, that's not good." // Could remove line
Max's eyes start darting while they think of what their next action should be.
"{player_name}, I'm gonna need you to do me a solid."
I have the feeling I'm about to be volunteered for something. //Oh, you don't like the sound of that.
"Well... It's Timothy's first day, so someone's gotta show him the ropes." # Keyless = Happy
"But I can't have my keys unaccounted for here."
"So could you be a pal and show him around?"
[{player_name}] "Uh..."
[Keyless>Max] "Thanks, buddy!"
And just like that, Max leaves me all alone with this new stranger. # Keyless = Exit
Timothy sighs dejectedly. Maybe he's used to this? // Could remove line
[{player_name}] "Uh... hey."
-> TakingTimothy

===Again===
What? # Keyless = Calm #Timothy=Calm
[Keyless>Max] "Hella Yella, my {player_name} fella."
[{player_name}] "huh?"
D-didn't Max say that before?
"uh?... Morning Max." 
[Keyless>Max] "Morning? It's almost noon! Don't tell me, I was your alarm clock this morning?"
[{player_name}] "W-What? N-no... @I, uh, was already awake."
Okay, I'm getting the strangest case of deja vu right now...
[Keyless>Max] "Das good. Das good. Y'all can't be relying on a the Max alarm pretty soon."
Okay, now its getting weird.
"Uh, hello? Earth to {player_name}. Ya still there?"
This doesn't feel real. Besides Max, I see... #Timothy=Calm
[{player_name}] "Timothy!"
[Timothy] "Meep!" #Timothy=Surprised
[{player_name}] "what are you doing back so soon?" #Timothy=Calm
"We're you being sent back to Blackwell Hospital?" #Timothy=Afraid
[Keyless>Max] "Uh, {player_name}, you still dreaming buddy?"
"Timothy Miyuri is the roommate I told you about."
Wait...
"You two will be sharing a room for the week, since we're kinda tight on space around here."
Wait...
[Keyless>Max] "Anyways, Timothy, this is {player_name}, pronouns are {pronouns}. You'll be sharing this room with {possesive} for the next week." # Keyless = Calm
[Timothy] "Okay." # Timothy = Calm
Timothy and Max both invite themselves into my room carrying several bags, likely full of Timothy's belongings.
Once Max has got all the bags in, they pat themselves down in a brief panic, before realizing something is wrong.
[Keyless>Max] "Oh crap." # Keyless = Surprised
[{player_name}] "What?"
[Keyless>Max] "It would seem I have misplaced my keys."
[{player_name}] "Again?"
[Keyless>Max] "Ah! I'm not that forgetful!" #Keyless=Sad
[{player_name}] "N-no, but, you lost them last week too, remember? they we're stuck in the couch cushions?"
[Keyless>Max] "Couch cushions? hm..." #Keyless=Calm
"One sec. I'mma be right back." #Keyless=Exit
And with that Max quickly runs off, leaving me and Timothy alone
[{player_name}] "Timothy, are getting really weird deja vu today too?"
Timothy is just kind of quietly staring at the corner where his bed is.
"Yo, Timothy, can you hear me?"
[Timothy] "<size=50%>I don't know you<size=100%>"
[{player_name}] "what?"
[Keyless>Max] "okay, I'm back!" #Max=Calm
"Anyways, where we're we Timothy?"
[Timothy] "You we're showing me around I think..."
[Keyless>Max] "Ah, yes."
"Well lets head off."
"See you at the welcome dinner {player_name}!" #Max=Exit #Timothy=Exit
Wait...
"Thanks again for the tip on the keys!"
And, they're gone...
What is even going on?
I'm left in my room, looking around. all of Timothy's stuff has been packed in the bags they brought in. 
My bags, on the other hand, have been emptied, and put away, from where I left them last night...
Last night....
[{player_name}] "Aggh!"
My head hurts, as if for a second I brain formed a splinting migraine, but I continue to follow the strangeness around me.
Was last night... really last night?
the knock on the door.@ Max introducing Timothy as if we never met.@ Timothy even still being here!
this can't all be just deja vu, can it?
I think.... I think I'm back on the first day Timothy arrived here.@ But how? why?
I sit there, alone with my thoughts, theorizing how or why this situation has come before me, before I realize the time.
[{player_name}] "I-I should go looking for someone."

same stuff as previously. to be expanded later.
for now, do you tell max where their keys are, and thus take Timothy around the home?
+[Yes, tell max where the keys are] ->Day1Alone

===RestartRequired===
Nonononono!
In a bolt, I'm out of bed, and sprint for the door.
This can't be happening. this can't be happening.

===TakingTimothy===
{SetValue("Tutorial", true)}
[{player_name}] "So, um..." #Timothy = Stage_center
Oh, man. I did not wake up expecting to be a tour guide today. Whatever.
"Well, this is my room. Although, I guess it'll be <i>our</i> room for the time being."
"You can come here if you want to just get away from it all and de-stress." # Stress * Show
"Also, obviously, you can just knock out here if you're too <color=color_wellbeing_penalty>fatigued</color> to do anything else. Or just whenever, really." # Fatigue * Show
"I try to limit myself to 8 hours a day." // Could remove line
Though I've been falling off the wagon more often as of late. // Could remove line
I go over and grab my watch off the desk beside my bed. Max was right, it is almost noon. He'll probably think I'm super weird, but Timothy should know about my system. // Could trim line
"So, uh... I don't know what brought you here and you don't have to tell me or anything, but one of the things I've suffered from before was Lost Time."
[Timothy] "You mean you'd lose track of time? Doesn't everybody do that?"
[{player_name}] "No, it's more like..."
"There would be entire hours where I'm just not home... up here."
"Hours, maybe days, that I couldn't account for and couldn't remember. As if the time was lost."
"The actual term is dissociative amnesia."
"It's a type of dissociation, where you lose hours or days of memory."
"For me, I've found out it tends to flair up when I'm more <color=color_wellbeing_penalty><i>depressed</i></color>." # Depression * Show
If I get too <color=color_wellbeing_penalty><i>depressed</i></color>, the amount of time it takes to do a task can <color=color_descriptor><i>double</i></color>, or even <color=color_descriptor><i>triple</i></color>.
"When I was at Blackwell the doctors told me to keep track of my time. I think it was mostly for them, so they'd know how bad things were." 
"But ever since I count and keep track of the hours of the day very closely." // I don't know how much this actually makes sense any more given the depression mechanic. Cut?
"I regiment what I do in a very hourly basis."
I flash Timothy the time on my watch, almost noon.
"C'mon, I'll show you."
I am really starting to get hungry, so my first move should be to show Timothy the Cafe area. # Timothy = Exit
~SetValue("Tutorial", true)

===Day1Alone===
{SetValue("Tutorial", false)}
I've been left alone on this morning.
I should actually go about my day...
