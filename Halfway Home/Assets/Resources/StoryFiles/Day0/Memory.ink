In my dreams I can still hear their voices.
I can see the faces my mind invented from shadow.
They whisper to me that I will never escape.
That I don't deserve to.
I had another of those dreams last night. That I was back in that sickly white room.
Alone.
But when I open my eyes, I can see the light streaming through the skinny window of my room.
The whispers fade into the chitter of birdsong.
I shudder at the thought of losing myself so deeply in my own mind. I often forget who I am in my dreams.
