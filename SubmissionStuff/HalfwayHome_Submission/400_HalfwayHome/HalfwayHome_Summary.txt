Halfway Home is a Visual Novel Stat Management Game, about recovery, mental health, and time.
The player controls a resident at this halfway home (default name is Sam), who is set to leave in 1 week.
Upon meeting the new resident Timothy, Sam sets out on a seemingly uneventful final week.
But when strange outcomes occur, and Sam ends the week waking up at its beginning again and again, 
its up to them to improve their social skills and break the Time Loop.
