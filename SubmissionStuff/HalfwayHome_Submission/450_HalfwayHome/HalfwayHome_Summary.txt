Halfway Home
By: Jesse Lozano & John Myres

Halfway Home is a Visual Novel Stat Management Game about friendship, mental health, and time.
The player takes on the role of a resident of Sunflower House, a halfway house dedicated to helping
people with a wide variety of mental disorders transition back into the community, during their
final week at the home.

Upon meeting new resident and roommate Timothy, Sam sets out on a seemingly uneventful final week.
But just as the week comes to a dramatic close, Sam's nightmare transports them to its beginning again. And again.
It's up to the player to improve their social skills, make new friends, and finally break the time loop for good.
